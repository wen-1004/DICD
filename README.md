# DICD

## Developement log

- Version 1: Initial build, wire connection and testbench formation
- Version 2: First standalone system simulation with all signal using "double"
- Version 3: Replace "double" with user-defined data type
- Version 4: Debugging, adjust Alpla-max approximation parameter, passed testcase
- Version 5: Trim redundant bits for datapath
- Version 6: Further reduce bits for datapath
- Version 7: **lastest verion, use this**Add 1 more latency in the system

## How to run

1. ./run_sim.sh to compile executable file
